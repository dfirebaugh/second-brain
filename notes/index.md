# About
This is a [digital garden ðŸŒ± or second brain ðŸ§ ](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) with some attempt at following [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) note taking.

Hopefully this site will become something that's easy for me to lookup things that I've already learned.
I intend to use this to collect notes and thoughts.


It's meant to be entirely self serving, but I guess there's a small chance that someone else might find value here.

#### Editor
I'm currently experimenting with using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit the markdown files for this site.

#### Publishing
I'm using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) as a static site generator and publishing the site through [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).
