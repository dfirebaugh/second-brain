   I'm in a bookclub with some friends.
   We take turns picking books.
   At any point we can (as a group) decide to shelf a book (which basically means we might come back to it, but we probably wont).

   We typically read about 150 pages every two weeks.

*** Rating system
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rating system 
:END:
    I'll loosely slap a rating on these based on how much I like the book.
    5 means i liked it a lot.

   - ðŸ“– - one point

   - ðŸ“ƒ - half a point 

   (e.g. ðŸ“–ðŸ“–ðŸ“ƒ == 2.5)
