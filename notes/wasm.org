I did a write up Web Assembly when i first took a look at it on my
[[https://dustinfirebaugh.com/blog/Web_Assembly/][blog]].

#+begin_quote
WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a
stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for
compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment
on the web for client and server applications ---

*** Microcontrollers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: microcontrollers
:END:
I think web assembly also has an interesting role to play in the
microcontroller space.

I'm specifically interested in this because it will allow for sandboxed
apps on a microcontroller that would also easily run in a different
environment (e.g.Â the browser).

It's also dynamically loadable. So, you could send a wasm file from one
microcontroller to another and run it.

*** Smart Contracts
:PROPERTIES:

It seems several major smart contract crypto currencies are moving to a
wasm vm.
