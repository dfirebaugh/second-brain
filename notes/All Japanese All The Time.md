# All Japanese All The Time
http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/
AJATT suggests to fully immerse yourself in the Japanese language.  However, it mainly supports doing things that you like doing, but with the Japanese language (e.g. playing video games, reading books, watching movies, etc...).

AJATT seems to be "make [[Spaced Repetition]] cards from content that you normally consume".

A primary concept is "Fun gets done."
