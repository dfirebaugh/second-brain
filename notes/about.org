This is a [[https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history][digital garden ðŸŒ±
or second brain ðŸ§ ]] with some attempt at following
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]] note
taking.

Hopefully this site will become something that's easy for me to lookup
things that I've already learned. I intend to use this to collect notes
and thoughts.

It's meant to be entirely self serving, but I guess there's a small
chance that someone else might find value here.

** How This site works
The notes exist in a flat directory (i.e. no sub directories). 
However, notes are linked together in a structured way.

At the bottom of each note a list of links (BackLinks) show what other notes link to it.

*** Why org files?
    I think markdown makes sense as a format that you expect other people to work with. However, this site is entirely for me.  I'm interested in exploring org mode and some of the features it provides.  

    The hope is that org mode might help make some of the not-so-fun tasks more fun and provide some personal book keeping/organization.  

    Since this site is mostly just links to links with some notes along the way, this seems like a reasonable place to get some org mode reps in.

    I'm also playing around with using [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][babel]] to do kind of a [[https://jupyter.org/][jupyter notebooks]] type of thing with languages other than python.

    org files and org mode seem to align with ideas/wants that i've already had.  
    e.g. 
    - this site
    - [[https://github.com/dfirebaugh/planjam][planjam]]
    - physical notebooks i've tried to keep
    - etc...

    I migrated this site from markdown to org files using [[https://pandoc.org/installing.html][pandoc]] and a simple bash script.
    This still required a bit of fixup, but the process was simple.

    Org files can directly translate to markdown files.  So, the cost to move back isn't much. Aside from completely clobbering git.
