- game design takes inspiration from other disciplines

- balance

- design is constraint

- what's the win state?

  - e.g. a competitive game is 0 sum (+1 win, -1 loss, 0 tie)

- story-tellers

  - will thinks the coolest stories come from the player

- games are based on agency (i did something - something happened)

  - broforce - the enemy kills you, they giggle

- emotional pallet

- maslovs pyramid - what's the motive of the character?

  - connecting base motives to larger aspirations

- abstractions/schema = (what's the difference between a dog or a cat -
  this is often things that are things we don't really actively think
  about but they typically have defined behavior)

- Player schema (how it operates/ how it behaves)

  - classification
  - causality
  - empathy
  - agency

- Player's mental model

- Enable player communities

  - every player is different
  - have the player see themselves (i.e. identity)
  - recognition (online communities around games)

- Player flow state (edge of abilities)

  - failure is interesting and understandable
  - building ability to problem solve and strategize
  - the player is the one adjusting the difficulty - player paced
  - more advanced systems use automation (dda?) to adjust difficulty
    automatically

- failure accelerates learning

  - the classic pottery class anecdote

- design need loops of successes and failures

  - ramp model up smoothly and gradually
  - simple model that gets more complex over time
  - variety of failure states can be humorous

- capturing metrics

- rewards and incentives

  - some of the more interesting rewards are those that players think
    they came up with themselves (discoveries)
  - exploits
  - purple cow
  - rewards are mechanisms to guide players
  - incentives are internal to the player
