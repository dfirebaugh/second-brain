### Plastic Love
[Plastic Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Love) is an excellent song by city pop legend Mariya Takeuchi.  The song wasn't that popular when it originally came out, but in modern day, Plastic Love has become insanely popular thanks to the power of the internet.

Plastic love is a narrative that touches on how we lean on consumerism(buying electronics) to fill in the dark/empty lives we have.

From a musical perspective, I find it interesting that the chorus/hook of the song doesn't show up until the song is about 80% done.
