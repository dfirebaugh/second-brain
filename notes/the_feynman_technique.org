* The Feynman Technique

1. Choose a concept
2. Learn the concept
3. Teach it to yourself or someone else
4. Return to source material if you get stuck
5. Simplify your explanation and create analogies

When you are forced to explain something, it will highlight what you
don't know (even though you thought you knew it).

"I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees
of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure about
anything. And there are many things I don't know anything about. It
doesn't frighten me!" --
