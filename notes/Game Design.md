# game design and theory - will wright class
* game design takes inspiration from other disciplines
* balance
* design is constraint
* what's the win state?
	* e.g. a competitive game is 0 sum (+1 win, -1 loss, 0 tie)


* story-tellers
	* will thinks the coolest stories come from the player

* games are based on agency (i did something - something happened)
	*  broforce - the enemy kills you, they giggle

* emotional pallet

* maslovs pyramid - what's the motive of the character?
	* connecting base motives to larger aspirations


- abstractions/schema = (what's the difference between a dog or a cat - this is often things that are things we don't really actively think about but they typically have defined behavior)


* Player schema (how it operates/ how it behaves)
	* classification
	* causality
	* empathy
	* agency

* Player's mental model

* Enable player communities
	* every player is different
	* have the player see themselves (i.e. identity)
	* recognition (online communities around games)

* Player flow state (edge of abilities)
	* failure is interesting and understandable
	* building ability to problem solve and strategize
	* the player is the one adjusting the difficulty - player paced
	* more advanced systems use automation (dda?) to adjust difficulty automatically


* failure accelerates learning
	* the classic pottery class anecdote

* design need loops of successes and failures
	* ramp model up smoothly and gradually
	* simple model that gets more complex over time
	* variety of failure states can be humorous

* capturing metrics

* rewards and incentives
	* some of the more interesting rewards are those that players think they came up with themselves (discoveries)
	* exploits
	* purple cow
	* rewards are mechanisms to guide players
	* incentives are internal to the player
