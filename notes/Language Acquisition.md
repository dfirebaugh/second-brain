# Language Acquisition

## Acquiring a language vs learning a language
[Steven Krashen](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html) suggests a better strategy for picking up a second language is through language acquisition.  This involves massive amount of input and minimal output in early stages.

[Steve Kaufmann](https://www.youtube.com/user/lingosteve) is also a big fan of the language acquisition approach.

[[All Japanese All The Time]] also seems to follow this strategy to some extent.  However, AJATT mainly suggests doing "things that you find fun" in the language (e.g. watching netflix or reading books).

[Matt vs Japan](https://www.youtube.com/user/MATTvsJapan) is also a big fan of language acquisition (he was big on the AJATT ideas).
