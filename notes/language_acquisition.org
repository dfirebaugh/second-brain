[[[#refold][Refold]]] seems to be an excellent roadmap for acquiring a
language.

[[https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html][Steven Krashen]] suggests
a better strategy for picking up a second language is through language
acquisition. This involves massive amount of input and minimal output in
early stages.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/lingosteve][Steve Kaufmann]] is also a
big fan of the language acquisition approach.

[[All Japanese All The Time]] also seems to follow this strategy to some
extent. However, AJATT mainly suggests doing "things that you find fun"
in the language (e.g.Â watching netflix or reading books).

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/MATTvsJapan][Matt vs Japan]] is also a
big fan of language acquisition (he was big on the AJATT ideas).
